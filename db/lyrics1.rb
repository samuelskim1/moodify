Daydreams

Sunny skies in the breeze

Maybe the best of me you will see

Lately

I\x27ve been getting no sleep

Only daydreams, daydreams

It\x27s you that is stuck on my mind

Every night you see

I take another look in your eye

Into eternity

To let you go I know I should

But to be honest I never really think I could

Leave you out of my mind

Out of my heart

Leave you out my memories, suddenly

Leave you out of my songs

It\x27s true

I can\x27t get over you

I know there\x27s no point for me to wait by your door

I\x27m alone in all the promises we swore

I\x27ve been down this road so many times before

You\x27ll see, I\x27ll be gone by the moment you wake

I\x27ll see you maybe, in my daydreams

It\x27s you that is stuck on my mind

Every night you see

I take another look in your eye

Into eternity

To let you go I know I should

But to be honest I never really think I could

Leave you out of my mind

Out of my heart

Leave you out my memories, suddenly

Leave you out of my songs

It\x27s true

I\x27m still not over you

Won\x27t you stay out of my mind

Out of my heart

Save me from my miserie

Won\x27t you please just stay the hell out of my songs

It\x27s true

I can\x27t get over you
