## Introduction ##

Moodify is a clone of the Spotify App. Spotify is a subscription music streaming service that offers users a vast library of music,podcasts, and more. Spotify users can view tracks, albums, and playlists of different artists. It also curates playlists based on your preferences and selection of music. As someone who is passionate about music, I was interested in building a music streaming platform similar to Spotify that enables its users to explore different types of music. The technologies implemented in this project include:

- Languages: Javascript, Ruby, HTML, and CSS
- Frontend: React-Redux
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Hosting: Render
- Asset Storage: AWS Simple Cloud Storage(S3)

## User Authentication/Home Page ##

A Moodify user will be able to sign up/log in to Moodify. If a user implements incorrect credentials, they will encounter Moodify's error handling. On a successful render, the user will be brought to the Home page where they will be presented with a random assortment of songs and albums.
